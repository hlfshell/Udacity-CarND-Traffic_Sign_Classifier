## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, I will be using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) combined with the LeNet CNN architecture to create a deep neural network that can identify signs.

This is a project from term 1 of the self driving car nanodegree program at Udacity.


`WRITEUP.md` contains the project writeup.

The `evaluation-signs` folder contains the images used for the "off the internet" testing of the model.

The jupyter notebook should be viewable through the `.pynb` file or the `.html` export of the notebook.
